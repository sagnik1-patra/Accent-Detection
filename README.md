This project is a complete pipeline for detecting the accent of a speaker using audio input, specifically .mp3 files recorded directly from the microphone. It includes data cleaning, feature extraction (MFCC + Chroma + Spectral Contrast + ZCR), CNN model training, prediction, and deployment.

Pads/normalizes features

Trains a CNN model

Saves:

Model to models/accent_model.keras

Label encoder to label_classes.npy

4.  Predict Accent from Voice
bash
Copy
Edit
python predict_accent.py
Records 5-second voice clip via microphone

Saves as .mp3 â†’ Converts to .wav
